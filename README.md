This project implements a rule-based chatbot that uses predefined rules to engage with users in natural language. The chatbot identifies user intents and generates appropriate responses based on a set of logical conditions. It can handle specific queries, provide information, and simulate a conversational flow. Designed for easy customization, users can add or modify rules to expand the chatbot's functionality. Built using Python, the project serves as a foundational tool for those interested in developing conversational agents.

Key Features:

Rule-based response generation
Customizable rule set
Simple user interaction
